## Cancer Diagnosis Analysis

Overview: This project analyzes cancer diagnosis data using various statistical and machine learning techniques. The dataset is sourced from Kaggle and contains features related to cancer diagnosis, including radius_mean, texture_mean, and various standard errors and worst-case values.

Project Overview

Dataset Overview:
The dataset includes features such as radius_mean, texture_mean, and other metrics related to cancer diagnosis.
Initial exploration involves checking the data structure and ensuring no missing values.

Data Exploration:
Used info() and head() functions to get an overview of the dataset.
Checked for missing values using isnull() to ensure data completeness.

Diagnosis Distribution:
Analyzed the distribution of diagnosis types using value_counts().
Visualized the distribution with a bar plot.

Statistical Analysis:
Calculated average values for various features using the mean() function.
Represented the average values with a box plot.
Computed median and standard deviation using median() and std() functions, respectively.
Used a violin plot to visualize the dispersion of features.

Feature Relationships:
Explored relationships between features using a correlation matrix.
Created pair plots to analyze the interactions between key features.

Feature Importance:
Assessed feature importance using a RandomForestClassifier.
Visualized the importance of features with a pie chart.

Conclusion:
Concluded that radius_worst is the most influential feature in predicting cancer diagnosis based on model analysis.
